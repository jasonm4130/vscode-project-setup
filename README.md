# VS Code Project Setup

## The Motivation:

I like having nice setups in VS Code for my projects, where linting auto-formats my code for me. This is all well and good until you start mixing in different code bases which might have differing style guides. Or maybe they are just project that you are working on yourself that have slightly different purposes.

Global settings for VS Code are great, but you might want things a little different for each project. This is where this tool comes in. It allows you to easily setup, linting and .vscode settings and extensions for projects so that you can quickly setup a new project.
